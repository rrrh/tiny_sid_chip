## How it works

This is a single-voice SID (MOS 6581) synthesizer implemented in Verilog. It receives register writes over SPI and produces a 1-bit PDM audio output via a first-order delta-sigma DAC.

**Architecture:**

- **SPI slave** (`spi_regs`) — CPOL=0/CPHA=0, 16-bit write-only transactions. Drives a 7-register byte-addressed bank controlling frequency, pulse width, ADSR rates, and waveform selection.
- **SID voice** (`sid_voice`) — 24-bit phase accumulator with four waveform generators (sawtooth, triangle, pulse, noise via 23-bit LFSR). Waveforms are OR-combined and shaped by an 8-bit ADSR envelope.
- **ADSR envelope** (`sid_asdr_generator`) — Linear attack/decay/sustain/release with power-of-2 rate prescalers, matching the original SID timing.
- **Delta-sigma DAC** (`delta_sigma_dac`) — First-order modulator converting the 12-bit audio sample to a 1-bit PDM stream at the system clock rate (50 MHz).

**SPI frame format (16-bit, MSB first):**

```
[15:13] = addr[2:0]   (register address 0-6)
[12:8]  = reserved    (ignored)
[7:0]   = data[7:0]   (8-bit register data)
```

**Register map:**

| Addr | Register | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| 0 | freq_lo | Frequency low byte — sid_frequency[7:0] |
| 1 | freq_hi | Frequency high byte — sid_frequency[15:8] |
| 2 | pw_lo | Pulse width low byte — sid_duration[7:0] |
| 3 | pw_hi | Pulse width high byte — sid_duration[15:8] |
| 4 | attack | attack[3:0] / decay[7:4] rate indices |
| 5 | sustain | sustain[3:0] / release[7:4] levels/rates |
| 6 | waveform | {noise, pulse, saw, tri, test, ring, sync, gate} |

## How to test

Connect an SPI master (e.g. microcontroller or Raspberry Pi) to `ui_in[0:2]`:

1. Write frequency: register 0 = low byte, register 1 = high byte (e.g. 4291 = 0x10C3 → write 0xC3 to addr 0, 0x10 to addr 1 for ~C4 at 50 MHz)
2. Write attack/decay to register 4 (e.g. 0x09 for fast attack, medium decay)
3. Write sustain/release to register 5 (e.g. 0x0F for full sustain, fast release)
4. Write waveform to register 6 with gate bit set (e.g. 0x21 for sawtooth + gate)
5. Listen to the PDM output on `uo_out[1]` through a reconstruction filter

## External hardware

An RC low-pass reconstruction filter is needed on the PDM output (`uo_out[1]`) to recover the analog audio signal:

- **R1** = 1.0 kOhm (series)
- **C1** = 4.7 nF (shunt to ground) — gives fc ~ 34 kHz
- **C2** = 1 uF (optional AC-coupling cap for amplifier input)

Connect the filter output to headphones or an audio amplifier.
