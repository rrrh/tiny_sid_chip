## How it works

This is a triple-voice SID (MOS 6581-inspired) synthesizer implemented in a single Verilog module. A host microcontroller writes per-voice registers through a flat memory-mapped parallel interface and the chip produces an 8-bit PWM audio output on `uo_out[0]`.

**Architecture:**

- **Flat register interface** -- rising-edge-triggered writes via `ui_in[7]` (WE), `ui_in[4:3]` (voice select), `ui_in[2:0]` (register address), `uio_in[7:0]` (data). No SPI or I2C overhead.
- **3-voice time-multiplexed pipeline** -- a single shared compute pipeline cycles through voices 0/1/2 every clock at 50 MHz (16.67 MHz per voice). A 4-bit accumulator prescaler divides the phase update rate by 16, giving ~15.9 Hz frequency resolution with 16-bit accumulators.
- **Waveform generation** -- four waveform types (sawtooth, triangle, variable-width pulse, noise via shared 4-bit LFSR), OR-combined per voice.
- **ADSR envelope** -- 4-bit linear envelope per voice with shared 18-bit prescaler. 13 distinct rate settings from ~1.3 ms to ~3.4 s per full traverse.
- **3-voice mixer** -- accumulates the three 12-bit voice outputs (waveform x envelope) over 3 clock cycles and shifts right by 2 to produce an 8-bit mix.
- **PWM audio** (`pwm_audio`) -- 8-bit PWM with a 255-clock period (~196 kHz at 50 MHz).

**Register map (per voice, selected by `ui_in[4:3]`):**

| Addr | Register | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| 0 | freq_lo | Frequency low byte -- frequency[7:0] |
| 1 | freq_hi | Frequency high byte -- frequency[15:8] |
| 2 | pw | Pulse width[7:0] (duty cycle threshold) |
| 3 | -- | Reserved |
| 4 | attack | attack_rate[3:0] / decay_rate[7:4] |
| 5 | sustain | sustain_level[3:0] / release_rate[7:4] |
| 6 | waveform | {noise, pulse, saw, tri, test, ring, sync, gate} |

**Frequency formula:**

```
freq_reg = round(desired_Hz * 65536 / 1041667)  ≈  desired_Hz * 0.06291
```

Attack and sustain registers are shared across all voices (written by any voice select).

## How to test

Connect a microcontroller to the parallel interface pins and the PWM output to a low-pass filter:

1. Set frequency: write `freq_lo` (reg 0) and `freq_hi` (reg 1) for the desired voice
2. Set pulse width if using pulse waveform: write `pw` (reg 2)
3. Set ADSR: write attack/decay rates (reg 4) and sustain level/release rate (reg 5)
4. Start the note: write waveform register (reg 6) with the desired waveform bit(s) and gate=1
5. Stop the note: write waveform register with gate=0 to trigger release
6. Repeat for voices 1 and 2 (`ui_in[4:3]` = 01, 10) for polyphony

The write sequence for each register: set `ui_in[2:0]` = address, `ui_in[4:3]` = voice, `uio_in` = data, then pulse `ui_in[7]` high for one clock cycle.

## External hardware

A second-order (two-stage) RC low-pass filter on `uo_out[0]` recovers the analog audio:

```
uo_out[0] ---[3.3k]---+---[3.3k]---+---[1uF]---> Audio Out
                       |            |
                     [1nF]        [1nF]
                       |            |
                      GND          GND
```

Connect the output to headphones (via op-amp buffer) or a line-level amplifier input.
